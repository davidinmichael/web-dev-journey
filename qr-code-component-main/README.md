### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned new ways I could center my elements, that's by wrapping them around a div tag and setting the image to flex display. This lets the browser know that the image is just another element in the div, that the div is main container.


### Continued development

A couple of things I didn't get correctly like reducing the thickness of the box by width, I will go back to spend sometime to really understand the technology and the process I could use to achieve this next time.
